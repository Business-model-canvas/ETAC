This repository includes the meterials realated “Emerging Technology Analysis Canvas” (ETAC), a framework to assess an individual emerging technology. Inspired by the Business Model Canvas, this approach includes a set of questions that probe the technology arranged around a logical narrative. it represents different aspects of technology visually on a single page. The visual representation is concise, compact, and comprehensible in a glance. We believe it provides a logical framework to understand the technology, provides a framework to look at different aspects of the technology, and can be used as a brainstorming tool when trying to understand emerging technologies.

You can find the specification from ![]ETAC.md](https://github.com/wso2/ETAC/blob/master/ETAC.md).
