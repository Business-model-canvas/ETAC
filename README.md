# Emerging Technology Analysis Canvas

A one-page Visual Canvas for Emerging Technology Evaluation, in the style of “the Business model Canvas

This repository includes the meterials realated “Emerging Technology Analysis Canvas” (ETAC), a framework to assess an individual emerging technology. 


It represents different aspects of technology visually on a single page inspired by the Business Model Canvas. This approach includes a set of questions that probe the technology arranged around a logical narrative. The visual representation is concise, compact, and comprehensible in a glance. 


We believe it provides a logical framework to understand the technology, provides a framework to teach, learn, and discuss different aspects of the technology, and can be used as a brainstorming tool when trying to understand emerging technologies.

You can find more details from [ETAC specification](https://github.com/wso2/ETAC/blob/master/ETAC.md).
